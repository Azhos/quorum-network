# Quorum Network

This repository contains Shell scritps and other code to deploy a Quorum network and smart contracts. The Installation and setup process is based on the instructions from the [Quorum Examples](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples) repository. It is a combination of the [7nodes](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples/blob/master/examples/7nodes) and the [5nodesRTGS](https://github.com/bacen/quorum-examples/tree/master/examples/5nodesRTGS) examples, but adapted to simplify the installation on servers instead of the use of a vagrant environment.
